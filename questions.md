 2. Describe your development environment. (Your OS, IDE, Editor and Config manager if any)

## Social Profile
 1. Your Github profile url.
 2. LinkedIn profile.
 3. Personal website, blog or something you want us to see.

## The real stuff.
 1. Which all programming languages are installed on your system.
 2. Write a function that takes a number and returns an array of its digits.
 3. Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “Join with storybox” becomes “oinjay ithway toryboxsay”.
 4. Write a function that rotates an array by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a copy of the array.


Note: It is not mandatory that you answer all the questions. You may leave some behind and
create a PR. However maximum questions will earn you maximum points. It is advised that you answer
all the puzzles in a language that you are applying for.
